# Marketing Campaign Dashboard in Excel

This project uses Excel to analyze a real-world marketing campaign dataset. I cleaned the data, engineered new features, and created an interactive dashboard that answers key business questions around customer behavior and campaign performance.

## Business Problem

Marketing teams often struggle to identify which customer segments are most engaged, where to focus their budget, and how people prefer to shop.

## My Solution

Using Excel, I:

• Cleaned raw customer data including missing values and inconsistent date formats  
• Created new features like Total Spend, Campaigns Accepted, and Month Joined  
• Used Pivot Tables and calculated columns to analyze key behavioral patterns  
• Built visuals to explore:  
   • Average Spend by Education  
   • Campaign Response by Marital Status  
   • Purchase Channels by Customer Segment  
   • Customer Growth Over Time  

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel  
• Pivot Tables  
• Conditional Formatting  
• Chart Creation  
• IF, SUM, TEXT, and DATE formulas  

## What I Learned

• How to clean and transform marketing data into usable insights  
• How to structure dashboards that answer real business questions  
• How to communicate behavior patterns clearly through charts and layout  

## Feedback
